# Data Analysis Tasks

This repository contains three main data analysis tasks: Data Manipulation, QoQ Analysis, and Visits Analysis. Each task involves different data manipulation and analysis techniques using Python and SQL.

## Directory Structure
- **Data_Manipulation**: Contains scripts and data for manipulating and analyzing clickstream data from Airbnb.
- **QoQ_Analysis**: Contains SQL scripts and data for performing quarter-over-quarter analysis of site visits.
- **Visits_Analysis**: Contains scripts and data for analyzing visit data from Zoom.

### Data_Manipulation
This task involves analyzing Airbnb clickstream data to identify top searched keywords. The analysis includes extracting keywords from URLs, counting their occurrences, and displaying the top results.

### QoQ_Analysis
This task involves performing a quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) analysis of site visits data. The goal is to identify the top 10 sites per country with the highest QoQ positive change in visits. The analysis includes creating and populating SQL tables, writing optimized queries, and generating visualizations.

### Visits_Analysis
This task involves analyzing visit data from Zoom to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) and perform cohort analysis. The analysis includes finding specific visits, calculating metrics, and creating visualizations to display the results.
